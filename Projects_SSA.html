<p>The
Lincoln Park Chamber of
Commerce entered into an agreement with
PLACE Consulting to reconstitute the Clark Street Special Service Area
#23 and to complete a preliminary market and consumer characteristics
analysis identifying key areas of consumer spending leakage. This
reconstitution effort is the result of a number of changes that have
occurred since the SSA was created in 2002 including the availability
of additional parcels to expand the SSA, a desire to reduce the number
of vacant storefronts, and a push to increase the overall vitality of
the service area through economic development initiatives. The SSA
reconstitution was completed and approved in the Fall of 2008.</p>

Regional Redevelopment Corporation<br />
Completed
Spring 2006</p>
<p>PLACE
consultants provided
capacity development and technical
assistance to the Regional Redevelopment Corporation and the Metro
Southland Chamber of Commerce to form two Special Service Areas (SSA)
in the Roseland neighborhood of Chicago. This effort represented the
first timethat two Special Service Areas were concurrently created in
the City of Chicago.</p>
<p>We
successfully weaved a number
of competing interests into a common
and implementable Special Service Area plan. The process required a
coordinated effort involving The Regional Redevelopment Development
Corporation, the City of Chicago Department of Planning and
Development, the Metro Southland Chamber of Commerce, two local
alderman and aldermanic staff, business and property owners and
interested community members. Our consultants facilitated several
public forums and property owner focus group sessions. Through these
meetings, a number of leaders emerged whom we identified and
recommended as candidates for the SSA Advisory Committees.</p>
<p>To
meet City of Chicago SSA
application guidelines, property tax
rate scenarios and service area boundaries were tested to generate an
appropriate level of tax revenue required to provide the services
desired by the respective 103rd Street and Michigan Avenue property
owners. This analysis helped form the initial SSA budget and scope of
potential SSA programs and services. Included in the analysis was an
examination of property tax classes (e.g. commercial, non-profit,
residential) and equalized assessed value of individual parcels. Once
consensus was reached, a final boundary was determined for each SSA and
a legal description, tax roll, and public notice mailing list was
generated. To promote the new SSA, we created a brochure detailing the
scope of services and its value to the Roseland community.</p>
<p>Our
consultants provided
direction and testimony at the City Council
introduction meeting. Furthering the capacity development of the
Roseland SSA organizations, we assisted Regional Redevelopment
Corporation with obtaining a Tax Anticipation Loan, which allowed the
community to begin implementing services immediately after City Council
approval and adoption of the SSA ordinances.</p>
<p>The
result is the successful
implementation of two Special Service
Areas in an area that needed assistance with landscaping,
beautification, safety, business recruitment and business retention.
The SSAs are integrated with other redevelopment plans being put into
action by the aldermen, the City of Chicago&rsquo;s Dept. of
Planning
and Development and private development.</p>
