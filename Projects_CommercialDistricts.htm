<p><b><font size="3">Lakeview East Business Attraction and Retention
Strategy<strong> </strong></font></b></p>
<p><b>Lakeview East Neighborhood, Chicago, IL</b></p>
<p><b>Completed January 2008</b></p>
<p>PLACE Consulting contracted with the Lakeview East Chamber of
Commerce to develop a comprehensive business retention and attraction
strategy for this very diverse and dense lakeside neighborhood on the
North Side of Chicago. The neighborhood prides itself on the array of
locally owned and unique restaurants, boutiques, and services. Lakeview
also enjoys a population density level similar to downtown levels
creating a thriving pedestrian environment with most business within
walking distance of neighborhood residents.</p>
<p>The Chamber recognized that businesses in the area are beginning to
feel the pressures of increasing rents as national retailers began
proliferating in the southern end of the neighborhood. In addition,
short-term leases are resulting in a higher rate of turn over than is
desired to maintain consistency and quality tenants. Finally, there is
a perception that neighborhood demographics have changed and that
perhaps the current business-mix may not have caught up to meet the
demand.</p>
<p>To address the Chamber&rsquo;s challenges, PLACE Consulting is in
the midst of inventorying and mapping business district conditions,
including vacancies and business types. An analysis of consumer
expenditure and retail spending data will be examined to identify areas
of potential leakage. Claritas psychographic data will be analyzed to
identify potential specialized retail and service niches not apparent
through traditional data sources. The complete economic analysis will
identify spending patterns, strength of local sales, retail
opportunities, and specialty niches that draw from beyond the
neighborhood and also identify potential new opportunities. PLACE is
also surveying property owners to better understand the local
challenges they face and how property owners and the Chamber can best
work together. The final result will be a strategy and associated
marketing materials, outlining appropriate special events and programs,
cost estimates, and implementation recommendations and timelines.</p>

<p><b><font size="3">Chicago Avenue Commerical Corridor Plan / Retail
Market Analysis</font></b></p>
<p><b>West Town Neighborhood, Chicago, IL</b></p>
<p><b>Completed Spring 2007</b></p>
<p>The newly established Special Service Area #29 hired members of
PLACE Consulting in the fall of 2006 to conduct a commercial corridor
analysis and develop materials for business recruitment. Special
Service Area #29 is charged with providing services for Chicago Avenue
between Halsted and California, a commercial area that transects at
least four different neighborhoods and two established ethnic enclaves.</p>
<p>Chicago Avenue was characterized by pockets of retail and
restaurants and benefited from being close to trendy neighborhoods that
attracted many shoppers and was well connected by public transportation
to downtown. Commercial vacancies, the lack of a recognizable identity,
and new development that only allowed for very small business uses were
all identified as challenges. Members of PLACE conducted an extensive
field survey to identify all the vacant storefronts, building
conditions, areas with bars and the windows and then mapped the
information using GIS.<br />
Shoppers and business surveys were administered to identify local
challenges and demands. The results of the surveys were used to provide
more depth to the economic opportunity analysis, which identified the
types of businesses that could be supported within walking distance,
the neighborhood and the regional areas. Finally a guideline document
was created for the Special Service Area manager that took into account
all of the research findings and made recommendations by sub-area,
including branding, positive clusters to build on, possible new
business types, and specific challenges to address.</p>
