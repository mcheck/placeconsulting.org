Street in the Lincoln Park Neighborhood, Chicago, IL</b></font></p>
<p><b>Client: Lincoln Park Chamber of Commerce</b></p>
<p><b>Completed Fall 2008</b></p>
<p>The Lincoln Park Chamber of Commerce entered into an agreement with
PLACE Consulting to reconstitute the Clark Street Special Service Area
#23 and to complete a preliminary market and consumer characteristics
analysis identifying key areas of consumer spending leakage. This
reconstitution effort is the result of a number of changes that have
occurred since the SSA was created in 2002 including the availability
of additional parcels to expand the SSA, a desire to reduce the number
of vacant storefronts, and a push to increase the overall vitality of
the service area through economic development initiatives. The SSA
reconstitution was completed and approved in the Fall of 2008.</p>
<p><font size="3"><b>Little Village, Chicago, IL</b></font></p>
<p><b>Client: Little Village Chamber of Commerce</b></p>
<p><b>Completed Fall 2008</b></p>
<p>PLACE Consulting worked with the Little Village Chamber of Commerce
under a tight deadline to double the size of the existing SSA in the
Little Village Neighborhood. PLACE worked the chamber to assess the
costs and benefits of including other areas, then worked with our
client through the entire SSA expansion process. The SSA reconstitution
process was completed and approved in the Fall of 2008.</p>
<p><font size="3"><b>Marquette Park, Chicago, IL</b></font></p>
<p><b>Client: Lithuanian Human Services</b></p>
<p><b>Completed Fall 2008</b></p>
<p>The Marquette Park SSA is the only primarily residential security
Special Service Area in the City of Chicago. PLACE Consulting
successfully lead a community driven process to reconstitute the
existing Special Serivce Area. The SSA reconstitution process was
completed and approved in the Fall of 2008.</p>
<p><b><font size="3">103rd Street and Michigan Avenue, Chicago, IL</font></b></p>
<p><b>Client: Regional Redevelopment Corporation</b></p>
<p><b>Completed Spring 2006</b></p>
<p>PLACE consultants provided capacity development and technical
assistance to the Regional Redevelopment Corporation and the Metro
Southland Chamber of Commerce to form two Special Service Areas (SSA)
in the Roseland neighborhood of Chicago. This effort represented the
first timethat two Special Service Areas were concurrently created in
the City of Chicago.</p>
<p>We successfully weaved a number of competing interests into a common
and implementable Special Service Area plan. The process required a
coordinated effort involving The Regional Redevelopment Development
Corporation, the City of Chicago Department of Planning and
Development, the Metro Southland Chamber of Commerce, two local
alderman and aldermanic staff, business and property owners and
interested community members. Our consultants facilitated several
public forums and property owner focus group sessions. Through these
meetings, a number of leaders emerged whom we identified and
recommended as candidates for the SSA Advisory Committees.</p>
<p>To meet City of Chicago SSA application guidelines, property tax
rate scenarios and service area boundaries were tested to generate an
appropriate level of tax revenue required to provide the services
desired by the respective 103rd Street and Michigan Avenue property
owners. This analysis helped form the initial SSA budget and scope of
potential SSA programs and services. Included in the analysis was an
examination of property tax classes (e.g. commercial, non-profit,
residential) and equalized assessed value of individual parcels. Once
consensus was reached, a final boundary was determined for each SSA and
a legal description, tax roll, and public notice mailing list was
generated. To promote the new SSA, we created a brochure detailing the
scope of services and its value to the Roseland community.</p>
<p>Our consultants provided direction and testimony at the City Council
introduction meeting. Furthering the capacity development of the
Roseland SSA organizations, we assisted Regional Redevelopment
Corporation with obtaining a Tax Anticipation Loan, which allowed the
community to begin implementing services immediately after City Council
approval and adoption of the SSA ordinances.</p>
<p>The result is the successful implementation of two Special Service
Areas in an area that needed assistance with landscaping,
beautification, safety, business recruitment and business retention.
The SSAs are integrated with other redevelopment plans being put into
action by the aldermen, the City of Chicago&rsquo;s Dept. of Planning
and Development and private develo</p>
