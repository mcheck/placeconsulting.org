<p><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Clark in Lincoln Park
Commercial District
Study</span></big><br />
Lincoln
Park Neighborhood, Chicago, IL<br />
Completed
Summer 2009</p>
<p> The Clark Street commercial
area in Lincoln Park had strong local spending power and a stable
community, yet was unable to compete with its more desirable regional
neighbors. While other commercial areas nearby had become destinations
for boutique clothing or a variety of dining options, Clark Street had
failed to capitalize on its own assets and had become a commercial area
without a compelling identity as well as lacking a critical mass of
strong destinations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lincoln Park Chamber of
Commerce hired PLACE Consulting in the Winter of 2008 to assess the
competitive strengths of Clark Street, understand the primary target
audiences and their needs, and then develop an economic development
plan for the district. PLACE conducted extensive interviews of local
shoppers, residents and leaders, analyzed the demographic and economic
data of Clark Street and its competitors and assessed the commercial
area&rsquo;s place in the local and regional economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLACE discovered resident
groups with clearly different needs and sub-districts with very
different opportunities and challenges as part of the economic
development plan. PLACE identified specific retail niche markets that
could be developed or supported to improve the competitiveness of the
district. Working collaboratively with the Chamber, PLACE developed
clear and implementable recommendations in three phases, created
engaging materials for proactive business recruitment, and produced
concise summaries of findings and recommendations to communicate the
plan to elected officials and neighborhood groups.

<p><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lakeview East Business
Attraction and
Retention
Strategy</span></big><br />
Lakeview
East Neighborhood, Chicago, IL<br />
Completed
January 2008</p>
<p>LVE is a dense lakefront
community of over 50,000 people on the
northside of Chicago. In 2007, the LVE Chamber of Commerce engaged
PLACE Consulting to develop a comprehensive business recruitment and
retention strategy for the neighborhood. While areas like Lakeview East
pride themselves on an array of locally owned restaurants and
boutiques, the neighborhood was feeling the pressure of rising rents
and suffering from increasing turnover. Additionally, there was a
perception that the composition and retail demands of the community
were changing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLACE worked with the Chamber
and SSA Committee to identify
priorities, map the current conditions of the commercial areas, discuss
challenges and priorities with business and property owners,
incorporate recent shopper survey findings, and analyze an array of
data to reveal current and projected demographics and spending
patterns. PLACE applied its unique analytical approach through an
assessment of psychographic groups, retail niches and local data to
fully understand the challenges and advantages of Lakeview
East.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on our own experience
implementing commercial corridor plans
and lessons form best-practices nationwide, PLACE developed an action
plan that included recommendations to address retention issues, viable
recruitment possibilities and district-wide improvements that were
needed. PLACE also developed eye-catching materials that highlighted
the key advantages of LVE as a place to do business, so the Chamber
could target the types of businesses that research indicated would fit
well in the community. A concise summary of the key findings and
recommendations was developed to communicate the vision, goals and
objectives to local elected officials and neighborhood groups.

<p><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Chicago Avenue Commerical
Corridor Plan /
Retail
Market Analysis</span></big><br />
West
Town Neighborhood, Chicago, IL<br />
Completed
Spring 2007</p>
<p>The newly established Special
Service Area #29 hired members of
PLACE Consulting in the fall of 2006 to conduct a commercial corridor
analysis and develop materials for business recruitment. Special
Service Area #29 is charged with providing services for Chicago Avenue
between Halsted and California, a commercial area that transects at
least four different neighborhoods and two established ethnic enclaves.</p>
<p>Chicago Avenue was
characterized by pockets of retail and
restaurants and benefited from being close to trendy neighborhoods that
attracted many shoppers and was well connected by public transportation
to downtown. Commercial vacancies, the lack of a recognizable identity,
and new development that only allowed for very small business uses were
all identified as challenges. Members of PLACE conducted an extensive
field survey to identify all the vacant storefronts, building
conditions, areas with bars and the windows and then mapped the
information using GIS.<br />
Shoppers and business surveys were administered to identify local
challenges and demands. The results of the surveys were used to provide
more depth to the economic opportunity analysis, which identified the
types of businesses that could be supported within walking distance,
the neighborhood and the regional areas. Finally a guideline document
was created for the Special Service Area manager that took into account
all of the research findings and made recommendations by sub-area,
including branding, positive clusters to build on, possible new
business types, and specific challenges to address.</p>
